Description
===========

Takes care of managing your hosts file entries (typically stored within
/etc/hosts) under Cygwin, GNU/Linux or OS X. You can say goodbye to manual
error-prone hand-edits. Further, managehosts keeps track of entries it has
added itself so it won't mess with existing customisations you may already
have.


Basic usage examples
====================

Add a hosts entry:
 # managehosts -i 1.2.3.4 -d upcomming-domain.com

Add another hosts entry:
 # managehosts -i 4.3.2.1 -d another.domain.com

List currently managed entries:
 $ managehosts -l
 1.2.3.4 upcomming-domain.com
 4.3.2.1 another.domain.com

Delete upcomming-domain.com hosts entry:
 # managehosts -D -d upcomming-domain.com

Add one more hosts entry:
 # managehosts -d mysweetdomain.com -i 1.1.1.1

Delete a hosts entry by IP address:
 # managehosts -D -i 4.3.2.1

Purge all managed entries:
 # managehosts -P
 Purging all entries...
  - 1.1.1.1 mysweetdomain.com


Documentation
=====================

There is none. The command will provide verbose usage output when run without
an argument. Alternatively, try running:
 $ managehosts -h

and look to the usage examples above.


To do
=====

* The hosts file location should not be hard-coded, particularly for Cygwin.
* There's probably a safe way to break up that regex string in checkValidIP()
* Implement a -q (quiet) option to prevent writing output to the screen.


Contribute
==========

Any contributions (patches, documentation improvements, etc.) are most welcome.
Additionally, if you have tested managehosts under OS X 10.6 or newer, feedback
would be appreciated as I no longer have a Mac to test with.
